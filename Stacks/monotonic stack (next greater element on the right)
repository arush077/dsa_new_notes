        // nge is easy using a monotonic stack(kuch nahi he bas piche se traverse karke stack fill karenge)
        // you can find nge of all the elements in nums2
        // uske baad nums1 me jo elements he bas unka answer return karna he by looking at nums2 ka nge
        // all in all nums2 ka hi nge chahiye



        // start travesing from the back
        // you need an element which is on the right and is just greater than the current element

        // is stack is empty you return a -1 
        // if the top in the stack is bigger than the current element then it is the answer
        // if the top in the stack is smaller than than the current element we start removing elements until we get a guy in stack which is bigger than the current element
