coin change -> denomination and target sum di hogi and u need to minimize the no of coins to make up that particular target value and u return min no of coins needed to make that sum





backtracking

n queens ->  


f(i){
    if(i==n){//here you get the entire thing}
    for(int j=0;j<n){
        if(valid(i,j)){
            grid[i][j] = 'Q'    //keep the queen 
            f(i+1);             //call aage
            grid[i][j] = '.'    //backtrack
        }
    }
}
}

go to each row one by one and inside that use a for loop to go to every element and check if you can keep the queen(only if valid) and remove queen while going back, if(i==n) pe you will get the final thing

isvalid me just check upar ka 1.top vertical, 2. slant top left, 3. slant top right  as you are going from upar se niche
