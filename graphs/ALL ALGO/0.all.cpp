FBD==> ye saare shortest distance wale he // FLoyd Warshall, Bellman Ford, Djkastra
Djkastra==> min dist from a src(one node) to all the nodes ==> VlogV same as nlogn as priority queue ya fir min heap use karte he isilie sorting ki time complexity aati he
BellmanFord=> Bellman same as Djkastra from one node to all the nodes ka min distance but negative edges allowed => O(v*e)
bfs in finding shortest distance == bfs works on undirected and unit weight graphs only || also minimum no of steps type of qns me to bfs is the best
Floyd Warshall=>Floyd gives you shortest pair between every 2 pair of vertices and negative edges are allowed => O(V^3) => because every loop across every vertice and every vertice par pura 2d vector check hoga so v*v^2
