//! Using DFS
//! Veasy bas ek path visited array banao
//! when it is visited but not pathvisited then cycle found


//! DFS visited and pathvisited maintain ==> yaad ye pathvisited backtrack hoga

//! if nn(new node ya fir adjnode ya fir neighbor) is visited and pathvisited both then loop exists

//! Warna alternative : BFS topological sort me no of elements =V nahi ayega
