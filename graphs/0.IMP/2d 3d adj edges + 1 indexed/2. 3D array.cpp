vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> adj

// outer vector ka datatype kya he and inner vector ka datatype kya he ???

//outer wale ka vector<  lookhere  > adj   ie lookhere = vector<pair<int,int>> he 

//inner wale ka vector<   vector< lookhere >   >  ie lookhere = pair<int,int>

0  --- {  pair,pair,pair }
1  ---

aur push_back karna ho to binadass

    adj[0].push_back({1,2});
     |             |
     |             |
     |             vector me push_back kar sakte
     |
ye ek vector he

















{{{                                               }}}
//!teen openbrackets saathme
//! 3D array

//! 2D array = 2 opening ayenge
{
    {},
    {}, 
    {}
}


//! 3D array = 3 opening ayenge
{
    {{},{},{}},
    {{},{},{}},
    {{},{},{}}
}

so {} is 1d
so {{}} is 2d 
so {{{}}} is 3d
simply see the no of opening brackets
