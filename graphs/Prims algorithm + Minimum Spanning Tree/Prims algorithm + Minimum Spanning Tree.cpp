What is a MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)

//! Graph(n nodes) ==> Tree me convert karte he taaki tree non-cyclic he + (the now made tree must contain n nodes and n-1 edges)

//!agar mst ke edges ko print karne bolra he to queue me (wt,node,parent)
//!agar sirf edge weights ka sum chahiye to fir simply (wt,node)
//!normal BFS algo but yaha pe we use a min heap taaki wt ko ham minimize kar paae
